Changelog
===========

0.0.77
------

- Fixed issue #467 - CVaR calculation returning NaN for DataFrame inputs:
  - The conditional_value_at_risk() function now properly handles DataFrame inputs
  - When filtering DataFrames, NaN values are now correctly removed before calculating the mean
  - CVaR calculations are now consistent between Series and DataFrame inputs
  - This fix ensures accurate risk metrics in HTML reports when using benchmarks

- Confirmed issue #468 is already resolved:
  - The "mode.use_inf_as_null" pandas option error reported in v0.0.64 no longer occurs
  - This issue was resolved in a previous version through updates to pandas compatibility

0.0.76
------

- Fixed issue #457 - Inconsistent benchmark EOY returns in reports:
  - Benchmark yearly returns now remain consistent regardless of strategy's trading calendar
  - HTML reports preserve original benchmark data for accurate EOY calculations
  - Previously, benchmark returns would change when aligned to different strategies' trading days
  - Added comprehensive tests to verify benchmark consistency across different comparisons

- Improved timezone handling for cross-market comparisons:
  - All resampling operations now normalize timezones to prevent comparison errors
  - Mixed timezone-aware and timezone-naive data can now be compared without errors
  - Data is converted to UTC then made timezone-naive for consistent comparisons
  - Fixes "Cannot compare dtypes datetime64[ns] and datetime64[ns, UTC]" errors

- Fixed FutureWarning for pandas pct_change():
  - Updated all pct_change() calls to use fill_method=None parameter
  - Prevents "fill_method='pad' is deprecated" warnings in pandas 2.x

  - Verified working with exact code examples from issue reporters

0.0.73
------

- Fixed payoff_ratio to handle DataFrame inputs properly (fixes issue #463)
  - When using qs.reports.html with a benchmark, payoff_ratio receives a DataFrame

  - Now properly handles both Series and scalar avg_loss values
  - Returns Series for DataFrame inputs, scalar for Series inputs

0.0.72
------

  - Handle invalid values when quantiles return NaN
  - Handle DataFrame inputs that return Series from quantile operations
  - Return NaN gracefully instead of triggering warnings

- Added comprehensive divide by zero protection across multiple stats functions:

  - recovery_factor: Returns NaN when no drawdown (max_dd = 0)
  - sortino: Returns NaN when downside deviation is 0
  - calmar: Returns NaN when max drawdown is 0
  - ulcer_performance_index: Returns NaN when ulcer index is 0
